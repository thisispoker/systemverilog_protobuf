# systemverilog_protobuf
protobuf is google's source code to do class serializations.
while in systemverilog, it is a hardware verification based language, so the software library is so limited.
but systemverilog has DPI to import c/c++ functions.
so this deposit is to show you how to using protobuf to do systemverilog class's serializtion and de-serialization.
